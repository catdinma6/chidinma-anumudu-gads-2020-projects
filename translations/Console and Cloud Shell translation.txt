LAB: CONSOLE AND CLOUD SHELL

Objectives:

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
•	Get access to Google Cloud.
•	Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.
•	Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.
•	Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

Task 1: Create a bucket using the Cloud Console

		gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

Task 2: Create a bucket using Cloud Shell

		gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>

Task 3: Explore more Cloud Shell features
 
--Upload a File
	Click the three dots icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar and Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. 
	The file will be referred to as [MY_FILE].
	In Cloud Shell, type ls to confirm that the file was uploaded.
--Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab:

		gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

You have uploaded a file to the Cloud Shell VM and copied it to the bucket.

Task 4: Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell

a.	Identify available regions
--Execute the following command to list available regions and Select a region:

		gcloud compute regions list

b.	Create and verify and environment variable
--Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

		INFRACLASS_REGION = [YOUR_REGION]

--Verify with echo:

		echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

c.	Append the environment variable to a file
--Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

		mkdir infraclass

--Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

		touch infraclass/config

--Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

		echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

--Create a second environment variable for your Project_ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID:

		INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

--Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

		echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

--Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

		source infraclass/config echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

--Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:

		echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

	Result: There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.

d.	Modify the bash profile and create persistence
--Edit the shell profile with the following command:

		nano .profile

--Add the following line to the end of the file:

		source infraclass/config

--Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.
--Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM
--Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:

		echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

Result: The expected value that you set in the config file is seen.
